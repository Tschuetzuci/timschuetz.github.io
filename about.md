I am a trained social scientist with a BA in Media, Communication and Cultural Studies from the University of Bremen, Germany (2012–2017). Currently, I am a master‘s student in Science and Technology Studies (STS) at the Goethe University Frankfurt and the University of California, Irvine (2018-19). 

My research interests focus on (alternative) digital technologies and infrastructures, hacker politics and culture, media and migration, critical humanitarianism, institutional ethnography as well as technology in the old age.

I am a fellow of the German National Academic Foundation (SDV) and the German-American Fulbright Foundation.

## CV

Please find below two different versions of my recent resume.

## The Name
Balzac was a famous writer, known for his beautiful prose. I read some Balzac in school, but mostly feel comfort in the name of my favorite coffee shop in Stratford, Ontario.
